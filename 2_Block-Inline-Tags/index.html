      <h1>Block-Level Elements</h1>
      <p>
        Starts on a New Line: A block-level element always begins on a new line.
        Even if there's available space on the current line, a block element
        will drop to the next line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Takes Full Width: By default, block-level elements will occupy 100% of
        the available width of their parent container, pushing other elements
        below them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Box Model Control: You can fully control the width, height, margin (all
        four sides: top, right, bottom, left), and padding (all four sides) of
        block-level elements using CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can Contain: Block-level elements can typically contain both other
        block-level elements and inline-level elements.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Inline-Level Elements</h1>
      <p>
        Does Not Start on a New Line: An inline-level element does not force a
        new line; it continues on the same line as its preceding content, as
        long as there's horizontal space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Takes Content Width Only: Inline elements only occupy as much width as
        their content requires. They don't stretch to fill the available space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Limited Box Model Control: width and height properties generally do not
        apply to inline elements (they are ignored). margin-top and
        margin-bottom generally do not apply (they are ignored and won't create
        vertical spacing). padding-top and padding-bottom do apply, but they
        won't affect the layout of elements around them vertically. They can
        overlap surrounding content. margin-left, margin-right, padding-left,
        and padding-right do apply and will create horizontal spacing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can Contain: Inline-level elements can typically only contain data
        (text) or other inline-level elements. They generally cannot contain
        block-level elements.
